Necessary Deliverables
A working site, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet.

A Git repository, hosted on GitHub, that includes a link to your hosted game and frequent commits dating back to the beginning of the project.

A README.md file with explanations of:

Technologies used.
Your process/approach.
Unsolved problems.
Your biggest wins and challenges.
Screenshots of the snippets of code you used to solve particularly interesting problems (think code highlights).

An in-class demo of the site that shows off the interactions you worked on.

A carousel whose images slide to the side on a timer, along with indicators that the user can click to navigate to a particular project.
